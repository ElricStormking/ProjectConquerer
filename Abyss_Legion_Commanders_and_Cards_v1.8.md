# 8. EXACT NUMERIC TUNING TABLES (v1.8)

These numbers are **first-pass tuning targets** for implementation and playtest.
They assume a standard “unit baseline” and scale with **cost**.

## 8.1 Global Combat Assumptions
**Tick / time**
- Simulation step: 60 FPS (fixed update recommended)
- Attacks resolved on animation event or projectile impact

**Tile + range**
- 1 tile = your fortress grid cell size
- “Melee range” = 1.0 tile
- “Short range” = 3.5 tiles
- “Mid range” = 5.0 tiles
- “Long range” = 7.0 tiles

**Damage types (for future resist hooks)**
- Physical
- Chaos
- Fire/Chaos (treated as Chaos for resist unless you split later)

**Armor model (simple)**
- DamageMultiplier = 100 / (100 + Armor)
- Armor can be negative (increases damage taken)

## 8.2 Baseline Scaling by Cost
These baselines define “typical unit” targets. Specific units deviate per role.

| Cost | Baseline HP | Baseline DPS | Baseline Armor | Baseline Move | Notes |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 1 | 180 | 25 | 0 | 1.20 | fodder |
| 2 | 320 | 40 | 5 | 1.15 | skirmisher |
| 3 | 520 | 60 | 10 | 1.05 | core fighter |
| 4 | 780 | 80 | 15 | 1.00 | elite core |
| 5 | 1100 | 105 | 25 | 0.90 | tank/elite |
| 6 | 1500 | 130 | 30 | 0.85 | boss-like |
> Move is tiles/sec. Adjust to your game feel.

## 8.3 Status Rules – Charm, Fear, Corruption

### Charm Diminishing Returns (DR)
Charm is powerful; use DR per-target to prevent perma-lock.

**Per-target Charm DR Window:** 18s rolling window  
- 1st charm: 100% duration  
- 2nd charm within window: 50% duration  
- 3rd charm within window: 25% duration  
- 4th charm within window: **immune** (0s)  
After 18s without charm, DR resets.

**Charm Immunity After Charm Ends:** 3s (prevents immediate re-charm)

**Elite/Boss Modifiers**
- Elite: charm duration × 0.50
- Boss: charm duration × 0.25 (or immune if you prefer)

### Fear Rules
Fear is shorter and less oppressive than charm.
- Fear DR window: 12s
- 1st fear: 100%
- 2nd fear: 60%
- 3rd fear: 30%
- 4th: immune
- Elite/Boss fear duration × 0.70

### Corruption (DoT + stack)
- Corruption stack max: 5
- Each stack: 6 DPS (chaos) for 6s (refreshes duration on reapply)
- At 5 stacks: **Corruption Detonation**
  - AoE radius: 2.0 tiles
  - Damage: 90 + (10 × attacker level scaling hook)
  - Spreads 2 stacks to enemies hit

## 8.4 UNIT STAT TABLES (Abyss Legion)

## 8.5 STRUCTURE STAT TABLES (8)

## 8.6 MODULE STAT TABLES (8)
Modules modify nearby tiles (adjacency radius default 2 tiles unless noted).

| Module | Cost | Effect (Numbers) |

## 8.7 SPELL STAT TABLES (7)

| Spell | Cost | Target | Numbers |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Chaos Bolt | 1 | single | 120 chaos dmg; applies 1 Corruption stack |
| Infernal Explosion | 2 | AoE | r=2.5, 160 fire/chaos dmg; applies burn 10 DPS 4s |
| Mass Fear | 2 | AoE | r=3.5, fear 1.0s base (DR applies) |
| Blood Pact | 1 | ally | Sacrifice lowest-HP allied cultist in r=2.5 (if none, does nothing); allies heal 8% max HP in r=3 |
| Corruption Wave | 3 | cone | cone length 6, width 4: applies 2 Corruption stacks + 80 dmg |
| Demonic Regrowth | 2 | aura | Allies in r=3 gain +2% max HP/s for 6s (does not stack; refreshes) |
| Abyssal Rift | 4 | zone | r=3, duration 8s: 25 DPS; spawns 1 imp every 3s; -30% healing received for enemies inside |

---

## 8.8 Quick Balance Checks (Sanity Targets)
- Cost 3 core units should die to ~8–11s of concentrated fire from a cost 3 ranged unit.
- Charm should never exceed ~35–45% uptime on elites due to DR + immunity.
- Regen-heavy units (Brute/Archdemon) must be countered by burst or anti-heal (-healing received in Rift).
